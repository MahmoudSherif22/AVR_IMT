# AVR Drivers Implementation Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing drivers for various peripherals on AVR microcontrollers (ATMEGA 32). The drivers developed so far include:

* DC Motor
* Stepper Motor
* LCD
* Keypad
* External Interrupt
* ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)
* Timer0
* Timer1
* Timer2
The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of drivers that facilitate easy interfacing and control of these peripherals for AVR-based applications.
